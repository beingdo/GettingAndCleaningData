For the peer assesment in the "Getting and CLeaning Data"

There is only one script contained in this file, which works through 3 steps:

1) Loads the data from the hardrive and merges it into one table as explained in the instructions

2) Creates a sub-data set that only contains the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. This data set i slabelled "DataMeanStd".

3) Creates a new independent dataset based on the one constructed in step 1. Note that there are certain measure variables that are dublicated and therefore collapsed during the process. The data set i slabelled "AveLabAct".


The only thing to do is to replace the distination folder for the data and the script should model the data as described in the assignment.  

I hope this is sufficient description.
